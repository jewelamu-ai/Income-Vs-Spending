## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. Generate App Icons

You need to create PNG icons in various sizes. Here's how:

**Option A: Use the Icon Generator**
1. Open `icon-generator.html` in your browser
2. Click "Download PNG" for each icon size
3. Save them in the `icons/` folder

**Option B: Use Online Tools**
1. Go to [PWA Icon Generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) or similar
2. Upload your logo or use the SVG from `icons/icon-192.svg`
3. Generate icons for these sizes: 72, 96, 128, 144, 152, 192, 384, 512
4. Save them as `icon-{size}.png` in the `icons/` folder

### 2. Test the PWA

**For Local Development:**
```bash
# Start a local server (if not already running)
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

**Test PWA Features:**
1. Open `http://localhost:8000` in Chrome/Edge
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Application tab
4. Check:
   - Service Worker is registered
   - Manifest is valid
   - App can be installed

### 3. Deploy to Production

**Important:** PWAs require HTTPS in production. Make sure your hosting supports SSL.

**Hosting Options:**
- **Netlify** - Automatic HTTPS, great for PWAs
- **Vercel** - Excellent PWA support
- **Firebase Hosting** - Perfect since you're already using Firebase
- **GitHub Pages** - Limited HTTPS support

## 🔧 How to Install the PWA

### On Mobile (iOS/Android)
1. Open the app in your browser
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App" prompt
3. Tap "Install"
4. App appears on home screen like a native app

### On Desktop (Chrome/Edge)
1. Click the install icon in the address bar
2. Or go to menu → "Install Budget Tracker"
3. App installs and appears in Start Menu/Applications

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
